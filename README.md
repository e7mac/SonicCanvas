SonicCanvas
===========

Vision
======
I wanted to create an experience of painting with your voice - the experience needed to make some sense but it needed to be balanced with a visually pleasing final product.

Technical Details
=================
The complete project is made in Processing. For audio in Processing, I used the minim library.

UX
==
The user can control a paintbrush on the screen by modifying parameters volume and pitch (actually implemented as the frequency centroid). There are also sonic boxes on the screen created using content taken as audio input to create a Mondrian-like feel.
